# Spring HTTP Buddy

**Turn your Spring controllers into ready-to-send `.http` request files — in one click, straight from the code.**

No more hand-writing requests in Postman or copy-pasting URLs. Spring HTTP Buddy reads your `@RestController` methods and generates a complete, ready-to-run request block above each one — with path variables, query params and JSON bodies already filled in from your DTOs.

The output is plain `.http` text, so it lives **right next to your code, in Git**, and runs as-is in [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), [httpYac](https://httpyac.github.io/), and the IntelliJ HTTP Client.

## Why Spring HTTP Buddy

- **Zero hand-writing** — Click a CodeLens, get a complete request. Path variables, query strings and request bodies are pre-filled.
- **Smart, type-aware defaults** — `String` → the field name, dates → ISO values, DTOs → recursively expanded JSON. Nested objects, `List`, `Map` and `@ModelAttribute` all handled.
- **Git-native, team-friendly** — Requests are plain text in your repo. Review them in PRs, version them with the code, share them with `git pull`. No accounts, no cloud lock-in.
- **Not tied to one tool** — Generates standard `.http`, so REST Client, httpYac and IntelliJ users on your team can all run the same files.
- **AI-assisted sample data** — One command copies a ready-made prompt so an AI assistant fills placeholders with realistic test values.

## Quick start

1. Install **Spring HTTP Buddy** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. (Recommended) Install **[httpYac](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anweber.vscode-httpyac)** — the best `.http` client for VS Code with environment variables, response assertions, and scripting support. The extension will remind you on first launch.
3. Open your Spring Boot project and any `@RestController`.
4. Click the **Generate HTTP Request** CodeLens above a mapping method.
5. Open the generated `.http` file and send it with httpYac.

That's it — no configuration required.

## See it in action

Given this controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody CreateUserRequest request) { ... }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
}
```

You get `src/main/resources/UserController.http`:

```http
### createUser
POST http://localhost:8080/api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "username",
  "email": "email",
  "age": 0,
  "active": false,
  "birthday": "2026-01-01",
  "address": {
    "street": "street",
    "city": "city"
  },
  "roles": [""]
}

### getUser
GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/1
```

## Commands

All available as CodeLens actions — no need to memorize anything.

| Command | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Generate HTTP Request** | Above a `@*Mapping` method | Creates/appends a ready-to-send block in `{Controller}.http` |
| **Open HTTP Request** | Above a `@*Mapping` method | Jumps to the matching `###` block (picker if several) |
| **Open Java Controller** | On a `###` block | Jumps back to the Java method that produced it |
| **Copy AI Parameter Prompt** | On a `###` block | Copies a prompt so an AI can fill in realistic sample values |
| **Import from Postman** | Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) | Converts a Postman Collection JSON file into `.http` format |

## Import from Postman

Migrating from Postman? You can import your existing Postman Collection into `.http` files in one step.

1. Export your collection from Postman as **Collection v2.1** (File → Export → Collection v2.1).
2. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3. Run **Spring HTTP Buddy: Import from Postman**.
4. Select the exported `.json` file.
5. Choose where to save (defaults to `src/main/resources/`).

The generated `.http` file preserves:
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Request body types (raw JSON, urlencoded, form-data, GraphQL, file)
- Headers, query parameters, and path variables
- Folder structure (flattened with prefix naming)
- Postman variables (`{{baseUrl}}`, `{{token}}`)

## Smart defaults

| Java type | Generated value |
|---|---|
| `String` | the field / parameter name, e.g. `"username"` |
| `int`, `long`, `BigDecimal`, … | `0` |
| `double`, `float` | `0.0` |
| `boolean` | `false` |
| `LocalDate` | `"2026-01-01"` |
| `LocalDateTime` / `Date` / `Instant` | `"2026-01-01T00:00:00"` |
| `List<X>` / `Set<X>` | `[<default of X>]` |
| `Map<K,V>` / array | `{}` / `[]` |
| Custom DTO | recursively expanded |

It also understands `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam` (with `defaultValue` / `required`), `@RequestHeader`, `@ModelAttribute` (flattened to query params, including nested objects), and a single `@RequestMapping` mapped to multiple verbs. Framework parameters like `HttpServletRequest` and `MultipartFile` are skipped automatically.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `springHttpBuddy.baseUrl` | `http://localhost:8080` | Base URL for generated requests. If left unset, the extension auto-detects `server.port` from `application.properties` / `application.yml` / `application.yaml` before falling back to this default. |

## Works great with Git & teams

Because requests are just `.http` files in your repo:

- Commit them alongside the controller — reviewers see exactly how an endpoint is called.
- A teammate clones the repo and instantly has every request, ready to run.
- Endpoint changed? Regenerate, and the diff shows what changed.

## Roadmap

Intentionally out of scope for now, candidates for future versions:

- Automatic `multipart/form-data` upload blocks for `MultipartFile` endpoints
- Environment-variable output (`{{baseUrl}}`, `{{token}}`) for cleaner multi-environment sharing
- OpenAPI/Swagger awareness

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Press **F5** to launch the Extension Development Host, then open a Spring project (a sample is included under [`demo/`](demo/)) and use the CodeLens actions.
